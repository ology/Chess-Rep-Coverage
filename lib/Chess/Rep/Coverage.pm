=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exposes the "potential energy" of a chess ply by returning
a hash reference of the board positions, pieces and their "attack or
protection status."

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Return a new C<Chess::Coverage> object.

=head2 coverage()

  $c = $gcoverage();

Set the C<cover> attribute and return a data structure, keyed on board
position, showing

  occupant            => Human readable piece name
  color               => Color number of the occupant
  index               => The C<Chess::Rep/Position> board position index
  move                => List of positions that are legal moves by this piece
  protects            => List of positions that are protected by this piece
  threatens           => List of positions that are threatened by this piece
  is_protected_by     => List of positions that protect this piece
  is_threatened_by    => List of positions that threaten this piece
  white_can_move_here => List of white piece positions that can move to this position
  black_can_move_here => List of black piece positions that can move to this position

=head2 board()

Return an ASCII board layout with threats, protections and move
statuses.

Protection and threat is indicated by C<p/t>.  White and black
movement is indicated by C<w:b>.

For example, the FEN C<8/8/8/3pr3/4P3/8/8/8 w ---- - 0 1> is rendered
as:

       A     B     C     D     E     F     G     H
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  3 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

  4 |     |     |     | 0:1 | 0/2 |     |     |     |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  5 |     |     |     | 1/1 | 0/0 | 0:1 | 0:1 | 0:1 |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  6 |     |     |     |     | 0:1 |     |     |     |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  7 |     |     |     |     | 0:1 |     |     |     |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  8 |     |     |     |     | 0:1 |     |     |     |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

This means that, 1) the black pawn at D5 can move to D4 and can
capture the white pawn at E4; 2) the white pawn at E4 can capture the
pawn at D5 but cannot move; 3) the black rook at E5 protects the black
pawn at D5, can capture the white pawn at E4 and can move to F5
through H5 or E6 through E8.

Compute probabilites of chess moves in a protective, threatening environment.
Copyright 2012 Gene Boggs <gene\@cpan.org>

Usage: perl $0 [0-9...] [0-9...] [t1,t2...] [0-9...] [p1,p2...]

Ordered arguments:
 'moves' is the number of moves of a piece.
    For example, a unobstructed knight can make eight moves.
 'threat' is the value or score of a single threat.
 'threatened moves' is a CSV list of threatened move numbers.
    This means that you can be captured by your enemy if you move there.
 'protect' is the value or score of a single protection.
 'protected moves' is a CSV list of protected move numbers.
    This means that you will be protected by an ally if you move there.

Examples:
 perl move-probability 8              # An unobstructed, unprotected knight
 perl move-probability 8 1            # Same
 perl move-probability 8 1 0          # Ditto
 perl move-probability 8 1 0 1        # "
 perl move-probability 8 1 0 1 0      # Right. Gotchya. 10-4 Good buddy.
 perl move-probability 8 1 1,8        # Threaten the 1st & 8th moves.
 perl move-probability 8 0 0 1 1,2    # Protect the 1st & 2nd moves.
 perl move-probability 8 1 1,8 1 1,2  # Protect & threaten
 perl move-probability 8 10 1,8       # Threaten with a penalty of 10.

* This logic does not treat "not making a move" as a value, at the moment...
